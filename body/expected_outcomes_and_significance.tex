\section{Expected Outcomes and Significance}
To evaluate the effectiveness of our work, as we mentioned in section
\ref{sec:ToolToAnalyze}, we can use a series of open-source test cases and benchmarks,
such as SPEC, UnixBench. 
We will also consider using SGXGauge \cite{Kumar2022ACB}, a test suite specifically
designed to test the performance of trusted systems, to measure the performance
of our tool.
Besides that, we are able to compare our tools with other cross-platform TEEs.
For example, we can use HyperEnclave \cite{Jia2022HyperEnclaveAO}, TrustVisor
\cite{McCune2010TrustVisorET}, Occlum \cite{Shen2020OcclumSA} and Graphene
\cite{Tsai2017GrapheneSGXAP} as baseline systems for performance analysis.

Although these cross-platform TEEs propose various solutions to address the
legacy softwares, most modify libraries and put them into the enclave.
This could lead to the expansion of the TCB and cause  an attack surface expansion.

Our solution uses binary rewriting to place the analyzed confidential code and data
into enclaves, hardening the legacy softwares and reducing the size of TCB.
We anticipate our tools for legacy softwares can reach the following goals:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The analysis tool can efficiently and accurately identify vulnerable code and data.
    Using analysis tool alone can help developers find software weaknesses and flaws.
    \item The binary rewriting tool can rewrite legacy softwares into enclave-protected programs
    with the help of analysis results.
    \item Our tools are extended to support distributed legacy programs.
    \item Based on the performance data, we design or modify the hardware.
    With hardware-assisted, we expect the performance can exceed other cross-platform TEEs
    or even approach the performance of native programs.
\end{enumerate}
