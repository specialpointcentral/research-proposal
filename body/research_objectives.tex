\section{Research Objectives}
As for my PhD research in trusted computing of general programs, the research
objectives are initially expected as follows, and the overall structure is
shown in the Figure \ref{fig:arch}.
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item Create an analysis system that dynamically analyzes general software
    that identifies which parts of the code are more vulnerable to attack and
    which data are essential and must be protected.
    \item Design a new compiler to support general, especially legacy
    software on trusted computing systems.    
    Using the analyzed data to guide the in-place binary translation,
    insert new code segments, which are used to protect code and migrate data into enclaves.
    Then the binary rewriting compiler builds a trusted environment at runtime.
    Also the migration instruction segments can be generated and added during the translation process.
    \item Extend the new compiler to support distributed programs with confidentiality and integrity guarantee.
    \item Create performance models and profilers to analyze performance bottlenecks at runtime
    and build new hardware primitives to fit the performance models and profiler.
    Explore hardware-software co-optimization with the help of the profiler to
    achieve efficient operation of the entire system.
\end{enumerate}
