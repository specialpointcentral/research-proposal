\section{Study Schedule}
My PhD research will mainly focus on the study of legacy software migration in trusted computing systems.
To achieve these goals, my preliminary arrangement is as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \nth{1} Year (2023-2024)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Complete the core courses and choose the elective courses
        that will help me with my research.
        \item Read the paper and design the whole system, while revising
        our current ideas and plans.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \nth{2} Year (2024-2025)
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Start to implement our analysis and rewrite tools based on
            first-year design.
            \item Publish the first paper about our analysis tools.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item \nth{3} Year (2025-2026)
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Modify and optimize our rewriting tools.
            \item Extend our tools to support distributed programs.
            \item Publish the second papers about our rewriting tools.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item \nth{4} Year (2025-2026)
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Review our entire system and analyze their performance bottlenecks.
            \item Try to improve the performance of migrated programs by
            modifying the hardware.
            \item Publish the third papers about our rewriting tools.
            \item Complete the graduation thesis.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
